              Ami is an incredibly talented Engineer and Manager. I've had the
              pleasure of working with her for over a year. As a leader she
              leads through kindness, empathy and example. Many in her team have
              called her "the best manager they've ever had". Her PR reviews are
              legendary, and she uses them as a teaching moment to level up
              other developers. She works well cross functionally and has the
              drive to work through ambiguity and uncertainty. I would recommend
              Ami 1000x over. She was an unbelievable asset to my team.

              Ami was my manager at Shopify for over a year, and has made a
              significant impact on my life and career. I would strongly
              recommend her to any organization looking for a skilled and
              compassionate manager with technical expertise. Ami's ability to
              empathize with and advocate for her reports is second to none. Her
              technical competence and leadership skills make her an excellent
              lead.
            </p>
            <p>
              As someone who has worked closely with Ami, I can attest to her
              ability to bring out the best in her team. She was not just a
              manager, but a mentor who helped me grow and develop my technical
              skills. She was always approachable and available to help, and I
              always felt comfortable asking her for guidance and advice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, I know Ami would be valuable to any organization lucky
              enough to have her. She has the skills, experience, and character
              to lead teams to success and help them thrive. I am confident that
              she will continue to make a positive impact wherever she goes, and
              I would work with her again in a heartbeat.

              I worked with Ami as a teammate for more than 3 years, and I'd
              count her among the best full-stack developers and leaders I've
              worked with. She never shied from any problem, took full ownership
              and responsibility for every project she led, and ensured we
              shipped the right thing on time. And somehow, she always made it a
              lot of fun.
            </p>
            <p>
              After we both changed teams at Shopify, I was able to watch as she
              transitioned into engineering management, and saw the deep level
              of care she had for each of her reports and how thoughtful she was
              supporting their growth, but also the attention to detail in
              ensuring the team was organized and effective. She's someone who's
              able to elevate those around her to achieve excellent results.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've worked with few people who have demonstrated such strong
              leadership in both technical and people management domains. It'd
              be a privilege for me to work alongside her again. And I
              absolutely recommend her for any staff developer or engineering
              manager role.

              Ami was my manager and mentor at Shopify. She was more than I
              could have ever hoped for:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                a natural leader able to see the good in all of us and bring out
                our best selves
              </li>
              <li>
                organized and willing to share in a way that enabled all of us
                to do our best work
              </li>
              <li>
                detail-oriented while still being able to think critically about
                the big picture
              </li>
              <li>
                focused on doing the right thing and delivering a quality
                product
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              She was also an incredible developer, able to analyze code changes
              from a single line of code all the way to broad multi-feature
              architectural-level changes. I could literally come to her with
              any question or problem, and she was there to help and pave the
              way for success.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would highly recommend Ami's work, both as a manager and a
              software developer. Not only is she excellent at delivering a
              quality product that any company would be proud to offer their
              clients, she's an amazing human being who approaches everything
              with care and kindness.
